            <p class="purim-intro-text">
                The story of Purim takes place in Ancient Persia, approximately 2,400 years ago. As recorded in the
                Book of Esther — the <em>Megillah</em> — the evil Haman convinced King Ahasuerus to sign a royal
                decree ordering the annihilation of the entire Jewish people. His plot was foiled by Queen Esther,
                who was secretly Jewish, and her wise and courageous cousin Mordechai. G‑d's name never appears
                in the Book of Esther — and yet His hand is visible in every twist and turn of the story.
                That hiddenness is itself one of Purim's deepest lessons.

                        <h3>A Fateful Party</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The story begins in the fourth century BCE, in the kingdom of Persia. More than fifty years had
                        passed since the destruction of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, and the Jews were scattered across
                        a vast empire of 127 provinces extending from India to Ethiopia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three years after King Ahasuerus ascended the Persian throne, feeling secure in his reign, he
                        celebrated with an extraordinary 180-day-long banquet for all the nobles and ministers of the
                        empire. Following this grand affair, he held a seven-day feast for the residents of the capital
                        city, Shushan. Meanwhile, in the women's quarters, Queen Vashti hosted her own celebration
                        for the women of the palace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the seventh day of the feast, with "his heart merry with wine," Ahasuerus commanded Vashti
                        to appear before his guests — he wanted to display her renowned beauty. She refused. Advised by
                        his minister Memuchan, the enraged king ordered her removal from the throne and her execution.

                <article class="purim-event">
                    <div class="purim-event__head">
                        <span class="purim-event__num">2</span>
                        <h3>The Beauty Contest</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        When the king's anger cooled, he was lonely for a queen. His advisers proposed a royal beauty
                        pageant: officials would gather all the most beautiful young women in the kingdom, and whoever
                        pleased the king most would become the new Queen of Persia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At that time, the leader of the Jewish community in Shushan was Mordechai, a man of deep faith
                        and wisdom. He had a cousin, Hadassah — known in Persian as Esther — who had been orphaned as
                        a child. Mordechai had raised her as his own daughter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though Esther had no desire to become queen, she was forcibly brought to the palace with the
                        other young women. While all the other contestants adorned themselves with perfumes and finery,
                        Esther did nothing special. Yet when she appeared before the king, he was immediately taken
                        with her, and she became the new Queen of Persia. But as Mordechai had instructed her, Esther
                        kept her Jewish identity completely hidden, even from the king himself.

                    <p>
                        Shortly after Esther became queen, Mordechai was sitting at the palace gate — a position that
                        allowed him to watch over Esther — when he overheard two of the king's chamberlains, Bigsan
                        and Teresh, plotting to assassinate Ahasuerus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mordechai immediately reported the plot to Esther, who passed the information to the king with
                        full credit given to Mordechai. The conspirators were investigated, found guilty, and hanged.
                        The act was recorded in the Royal Chronicles — but Mordechai received no reward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This seemingly small detail — an unrewarded good deed recorded in a royal book — would become
                        a pivotal turning point when G‑d's hidden plan began to unfold.

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, a minister named Haman rose to the position of prime minister. Haman was no ordinary
                        political figure — he was a descendant of Amalek, the nation that was the sworn enemy of Israel
                        throughout the ages. His hatred of the Jewish people was deep, visceral, and generational.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After his promotion, the king issued a decree ordering everyone to bow to Haman whenever he passed.
                        Haman reportedly wore a large idol around his neck, making such bowing an act of idolatry — something
                        a Jew could never do. When Mordechai, a proud Jew, refused to bow, Haman was filled with fury.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Haman did not seek revenge against Mordechai alone. He resolved to destroy the entire Jewish
                        people. He cast lots — called <em>purim</em> in Hebrew — to determine the most auspicious month
                        for his plan. The lot fell on the 13th day of Adar. Armed with his chosen date, Haman approached
                        the king.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "There is a certain people scattered throughout the empire," Haman told Ahasuerus, "whose laws are
                        different from every other people, and who do not observe the king's laws. It is not in the king's
                        interest to tolerate them." He offered the king 10,000 silver talents to finance the extermination.
                        Ahasuerus, who was no friend of the Jews himself, told Haman: "The money is yours to keep, and the
                        nation is yours to do with as you please."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sealed with the royal signet ring, a decree was sent to every corner of the empire: on the 13th of
                        Adar, all Jews — men, women, and children — were to be killed and their property seized. The city
                        of Shushan was in confusion, but Haman sat down to drink.

                    <p>
                        When Mordechai learned of the decree, he rent his garments and donned sackcloth and ashes — the
                        traditional sign of mourning. He cried out bitterly at the palace gate. Throughout the empire,
                        Jews wept, fasted, and prayed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Esther heard about Mordechai's state and sent him clothing. He refused it and instead sent her a
                        copy of the decree, asking her to go to the king and plead for her people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Esther responded with a sobering reality: "Anyone who enters the king's inner chamber without
                        being summoned is put to death — unless the king extends his golden scepter. And I have not been
                        summoned by the king for thirty days."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mordechai's reply was one of the most stirring speeches in all of Jewish history:
                    </p>
                    <div class="purim-inline-quote">
                        <p>"Do not imagine that you will escape the fate of all the Jews because you are in the king's
                        palace. For if you remain silent at this time, relief and salvation will come to the Jews from
                        another source — and you and your father's house will be lost. And who knows — perhaps for just
                        such a moment as this you arrived at your royal position."</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Esther agreed. But first, she made a request: gather every Jew in Shushan and fast for three
                        full days — no food, no water. She and her maidens would do the same. And then — "I will go to
                        the king, though it is against the law, and if I perish, I perish."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mordechai gathered the Jews of Shushan, including 22,000 Jewish children, who fasted, repented,
                        and prayed with all their hearts to G‑d.

                    <p>
                        On the third day, Esther dressed in royal garments — not out of vanity, but to carry herself
                        with the dignity of a queen before the king. She stood at the entrance to the inner chamber.
                        The king looked up — and extended the golden scepter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "What is it, Queen Esther?" he asked warmly. "Whatever you ask, even half the kingdom, it shall
                        be granted to you."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Esther did not reveal her request immediately. Instead, she invited the king and Haman to a
                        private wine feast she had prepared. They came. At the feast, the king again asked what she
                        wanted. Her reply was unexpected: "My request is this — that the king and Haman come to a
                        second feast tomorrow, and then I will tell you."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Esther was waiting for the right moment — guided, the sages explain, by a kind of Divine
                        intuition about when to act and when to hold back.

                    <p>
                        Haman left the first feast in high spirits. He alone had been invited to dine with the king
                        and queen! But as he passed through the palace gate, he saw Mordechai — who still refused to
                        stand or bow. Haman's joy turned to rage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At home, his wife Zeresh and advisers urged him to build a gallows fifty cubits high and go to
                        the king in the morning to request permission to hang Mordechai on it. Haman liked the idea.
                        He had the gallows built that very night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That same night — the night before the second feast — the king could not sleep. He had his
                        servants read to him from the Royal Chronicles. They happened to read the account of how
                        Mordechai had once uncovered and reported the plot to assassinate Ahasuerus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Was he rewarded for this?" the king asked. "No," came the answer. "Nothing was done for him."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At that exact moment, Haman arrived at the outer courtyard — ready to ask permission to hang
                        Mordechai. Before he could speak, the king called out to him: "Haman — what should be done for
                        a man whom the king wishes to honor?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Haman, certain the king was speaking of him, replied grandly: "Let royal garments be brought,
                        and a royal horse. Let one of the king's nobles lead him through the city proclaiming: 'So is
                        done for the man whom the king wishes to honor!'"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Excellent," said the king. "Do exactly this for Mordechai the Jew who sits at the king's gate."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Haman had no choice. He personally dressed Mordechai in royal garments, placed him on the king's
                        horse, and led him through the streets of Shushan, calling out his honor. Then he rushed home,
                        ashamed and humiliated. His wife and wise men told him: "If Mordechai is of Jewish descent,
                        you will surely fall before him." Then the king's servants arrived to bring Haman to the feast.

                    <p>
                        At the second feast, the king again asked Esther: "What is your wish, Queen Esther? It shall
                        be granted to you, even half the kingdom."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This time, Esther spoke. Her voice was steady, her words precise:
                    </p>
                    <div class="purim-inline-quote">
                        <p>"If I have found favor in the king's eyes, and if it pleases the king — let my life be given
                        to me as my wish, and the lives of my people as my request. For my people and I have been sold
                        to be destroyed, killed, and annihilated."</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        "Who is he — where is the man — who dares to do this?" the king demanded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Esther pointed to the man reclining at the table across from them: "The adversary and enemy is
                        this wicked Haman."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ahasuerus was furious. He stepped outside to the palace garden. Haman threw himself on Esther's
                        couch to beg for his life. When the king returned and saw this, he took it as another offense.
                        "Will he also force himself upon the queen in my own palace?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A servant pointed out the gallows Haman had built for Mordechai — fifty cubits high, visible
                        across the city. "Hang him on it," the king ordered. And so Haman was hanged on the very gallows
                        he had built for Mordechai. The king's fury subsided.

                    <p>
                        Haman was dead — but his sealed decree remained in force. According to the laws of Persia and
                        Media, a decree sealed by the royal ring could not simply be rescinded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Esther returned to plead before the king. This time, she fell at his feet weeping, begging him
                        to avert Haman's evil plan. The king again extended his scepter, raising her up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That same day, Ahasuerus gave Haman's estate to Esther, and appointed Mordechai as the new
                        prime minister — Haman's replacement. The king also gave Mordechai his own signet ring —
                        the same ring that had sealed the original decree of destruction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mordechai and Esther immediately wrote a new royal decree, sealed with the king's ring, and
                        sent it to all 127 provinces: the Jews had the right to assemble and defend themselves against
                        any who attacked them — and to take the property of their enemies. By this time, with a Jewish
                        queen and a Jewish prime minister now openly known, the balance of power had visibly shifted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In every province, the Jews celebrated. There was joy and gladness, and many people of other
                        nations declared themselves Jewish — for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.

                        <h3>The Day of Battle — and Victory</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        On the 13th of Adar — the very day Haman had chosen for destruction — the Jews of every province
                        mobilized to defend themselves. The enemies who had hoped to overpower them were defeated.
                        Throughout the empire, 75,000 enemies were killed. In the capital Shushan, among the fallen
                        were Haman's ten sons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Esther made one more request: let the Jews of Shushan have an additional day — the 14th of Adar —
                        to complete the battle. The king granted it. On the 15th of Adar, the Jews of Shushan rested
                        and celebrated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rest of the Jewish world celebrated on the 14th of Adar. That is why to this day, Purim is
                        observed on the 14th by most communities, and on the 15th — called <em>Shushan Purim</em> — in
                        walled cities like Jerusalem.

                        <h3>In Commemoration — A Holiday Forever</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Mordechai and Esther established Purim as a permanent holiday for the Jewish people and their
                        descendants — for all generations. They wrote letters to the Jews of all the provinces, near and
                        far, instructing them to celebrate these days annually:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="purim-list">
                        <li>With <strong>feasting and joy</strong> (<em>mishteh v'simcha</em>)</li>
                        <li>With <strong>sending gifts of food</strong> to one another (<em>mishloach manot</em>)</li>
                        <li>With <strong>gifts to the poor</strong> (<em>matanot la'evyonim</em>)</li>
                        <li>With <strong>reading the Megillah</strong> — Esther's scroll — night and morning</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Purim, the sages teach, is the most joyful holiday on the entire Jewish calendar — even more
                        joyful than the other holidays. Its name comes from the word <em>pur</em> — the lot that Haman
                        cast to destroy the Jews, which G‑d transformed into the foundation of their greatest celebration.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>G‑d's hiddenness is not His absence.</strong> The Megillah never mentions G‑d's name
                        explicitly — yet every "coincidence" in the story is His fingerprint.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>One person's courage can save a nation.</strong> Esther could have stayed silent. She chose
                        to act — and that choice changed everything.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Unity is a spiritual force.</strong> Mordechai gathered all the Jews — especially the
                        children — to fast and pray together. Their solidarity preceded the salvation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Joy is a form of faith.</strong> Celebrating on Purim, even with intensity, is itself a
                        declaration: we trust in G‑d's ultimate care for His people.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Each person has a unique role.</strong> "And who knows — perhaps for just such a moment
                        you arrived here." You are placed exactly where you are for a reason.

                <h2>How Purim Is Celebrated</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Read the Megillah</strong> — Megillat Esther is chanted from a handwritten parchment scroll,
                        once at night and once during the day. The congregation drowns out Haman's name with noise and rattles (<em>graggers</em>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mishloach Manot</strong> — Send a gift of at least two ready-to-eat foods to at least one
                        friend. This builds connection and community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Matanot La'Evyonim</strong> — Give monetary gifts to at least two poor people on Purim day
                        itself, so they too can celebrate. This is a halacha, not just a custom.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Seudat Purim</strong> — Hold a festive meal during the day with family and friends,
                        including wine, singing, Torah discussion, and joy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Costumes</strong> — Dressing up reflects the hidden and revealed nature of the Purim story.
                        Even the disguised can carry great meaning.
                    </li>

            <p>
                Esther did not wait for permission. She did not wait until it was safe. She said,
                <em>"If I perish, I perish"</em> — and she moved forward. That one step of courage,
                taken with full awareness of the cost, became the hinge upon which history turned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ask yourself: <strong>Where am I being called to act, even when it feels too risky?</strong>
                Where is my own story asking me to be the person who steps forward rather than waits?
            </p>
            <p>
                Purim is not only a historical memory. It is an annual invitation — to find the Esther
                within yourself. To look at your life, your relationships, your community, and ask:
                perhaps for just such a moment as this, I am exactly where I am.
            </p>
            <p class="purim-closing">
                <strong>Chag Purim Sameach.</strong> May this holiday fill your home with light, laughter,
                and a deep trust in the guiding hand of Hashem — seen or hidden, always present.
