    translation: "Who is wise? The one who learns from every person.",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 4:1",
    reflection: "Spoken by Ben Zoma, this teaching redefines wisdom not as an accumulation of facts, but as a character trait of openness. True wisdom is realizing that everyone you meet—regardless of their status or education—has something unique to teach you."

    hebrew: "אֵיזֶהוּ גִבּוֹר? הַכּוֹבֵשׁ אֶת יִצְרוֹ",
    translation: "Who is mighty? The one who subdues their own impulses.",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 4:1",
    reflection: "In a world that often equates strength with physical power or dominance over others, Ben Zoma argues that the true warrior is the one who fights the internal battle. Real strength is the internal discipline to control your own anger, ego, and desires."
  },

    id: 3,
    hebrew: "אֵיזֶהוּ עָשִׁיר? הַשָּׂמֵחַ בְּחֶלְקוֹ",
    translation: "Who is rich? The one who rejoices in their portion.",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 4:1",
    reflection: "Ben Zoma counters the human tendency to constantly desire what we do not have. Wealth is a state of mind; it isn't found in accumulating more things, but in cultivating gratitude for what you already have."

    translation: "Who is honored? The one who honors others.",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 4:1",
    reflection: "Using the term 'Briyot' (creations), this teaching implies that honoring people is honoring the Creator who made them. Respect is a boomerang; you earn it by giving it away. When you treat every human being with dignity, you elevate your own dignity."

    translation: "For a righteous person falls seven times, and rises again.",
    source: "Proverbs 24:16",
    reflection: "Attributed to King Solomon, this proverb observes that righteousness is not about perfection, but about persistence. Failure is not the opposite of success; it is part of success. A righteous person isn't someone who never fails, but someone who refuses to stay down."

    source: "Joshua 1:9",
    reflection: "God spoke these words to Joshua after Moses died, when Joshua was tasked with the daunting mission of leading the people into Israel. Courage doesn't mean you aren't afraid; it means you move forward despite your fear, trusting that you are not alone."

    translation: "The soul of man is the candle of God.",
    source: "Proverbs 20:27",
    reflection: "King Solomon uses the metaphor of light, as candles were the primary tools to search hidden places in the ancient world. You carry a divine spark within you, and your purpose is to let that light shine, illuminating the darkness in your own unique way."

    hebrew: "רַחֲמָנָא לִבָּא בָּעֵי",
    translation: "The Compassionate One desires the heart.",
    source: "Sanhedrin 106b / Zohar",
    reflection: "This concept from the Sages and Jewish Mysticism emphasizes that God looks past external rituals to the internal intent (kavanah). It's not just about your actions on the outside, but your intention on the inside; sincerity and passion matter more than robotic perfection."

    translation: "Walk humbly with your God.",
    source: "Micah 6:8",
    reflection: "The Prophet Micah summed up the entire Torah into three requirements: Justice, Kindness, and Humility, speaking to a generation obsessed with grand public sacrifices. True greatness is quiet; you don't need to broadcast your virtues, as living them with modesty and integrity is enough."
  },
  {

    translation: "In the image of God He created him.",

    translation: "Love your neighbor as yourself.",
    source: "Leviticus 19:18",
    reflection: "Part of the Holiness Code, Rabbi Akiva called this the 'Great Principle of the Torah.' It teaches that we are all connected, and treating others with love is the ultimate expression of our humanity."

    id: 12,
    hebrew: "מָ֣וֶת וְ֭חַיִּים בְּיַד־לָשׁ֑וֹן",
    translation: "Death and life are in the power of the tongue.",
    source: "Proverbs 18:21",
    reflection: "King Solomon warns that while words in a royal court could literally lead to execution, metaphorically they can kill spirits. Your words create reality; you have the power to build someone up or tear them down in a single sentence, so choose to speak life."
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    hebrew: "בַּקֵּ֖שׁ שָׁל֣וֹם וְרׇדְפֵֽהוּ",
    translation: "Seek peace and pursue it.",
    source: "Psalm 34:15",
    reflection: "Written by King David while fleeing for his life, this verse teaches that peace requires active pursuit. Peace doesn't just happen; you have to chase after it, actively working to reconcile differences and create harmony."
  },

    hebrew: "יְהִי בֵיתְךָ פָתוּחַ לִרְוָחָה",
    translation: "Let your house be open wide.",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 1:5",
    reflection: "Yossi ben Yochanan lived during a time of social stratification and emphasized the home as a center of kindness, modeled after Abraham's tent. An open home leads to an open heart; sharing your space and resources creates a community of kindness."

    translation: "Judge every person favorably.",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 1:6",
    reflection: "Yehoshua ben Perachiah, a leader during a time of political polarization, urged people to interpret ambiguity in others' actions positively. Give people the benefit of the doubt; when you look for the good in others, you often bring out the best in them."
  },

    id: 16,
    hebrew: "וּקְנֵה לְךָ חָבֵר",
    translation: "Acquire for yourself a friend.",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 1:6",
    reflection: "The use of the word 'acquire' implies that friendship requires an investment, much like a purchase. Friends are not just found; they are earned through effort, investment, and loyalty. A true friend is a partner in your growth."
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    hebrew: "כַּ֭מַּיִם הַפָּנִ֣ים לַפָּנִ֑ים כֵּ֤ן לֵֽב־הָ֝אָדָ֗ם לָאָדָֽם",
    translation: "As water reflects the face, so one heart reflects another.",
    source: "Proverbs 27:19",
    reflection: "Before mirrors, water was the only reflection; just as water smiles back if you smile, King Solomon observed this psychological mirroring in relationships. The energy you put out is the energy you get back—show love, and you will find it reflected in the hearts of others."
  },
  {
    id: 18,

    translation: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity.",
    source: "Psalm 133:1",
    reflection: "This Song of Ascents was sung by pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem, celebrating the rare moments when all tribes stood together. There is a unique spiritual power when people set aside their differences and live in harmony; unity is a vessel for blessing."
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    hebrew: "שַׁלַּ֥ח לַחְמְךָ֖ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י הַמָּ֑יִם",
    translation: "Cast your bread upon the waters.",
    source: "Ecclesiastes 11:1",
    reflection: "King Solomon suggests taking risks in generosity, even when the return isn't immediately visible. Do good without expecting an immediate reward; kindness has a ripple effect, and eventually, the good you put into the world will return to you."
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    hebrew: "כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל עֲרֵבִים זֶה בָּזֶה",
    translation: "All of Israel are responsible for one another.",
    source: "Talmud Shavuot 39a",
    reflection: "The Sages discussed communal liability using the word 'arevim' (guarantors). We are not isolated individuals; we are part of a greater whole. When one person falls, we all feel it, and when one rises, we all rise."

    translation: "If I am not for myself, who will be for me?",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 1:14",
    reflection: "Hillel the Elder taught personal responsibility as the first step in ethical living. You must take ownership of your own life and well-being; no one else can do your work for you."
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    hebrew: "וּכְשֶׁאֲנִי לְעַצְמִי, מָה אֲנִי?",
    translation: "And if I am only for myself, what am I?",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 1:14",
    reflection: "Hillel balances his previous statement by warning that self-care without care for others leads to an empty existence. Self-care is necessary, but selfishness is empty; a meaningful life is one lived in service to others."
  },
  {
    id: 23,
    hebrew: "וְאִם לֹא עַכְשָׁיו, אֵימָתַי?",
    translation: "And if not now, when?",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 1:14",
    reflection: "Hillel concludes his famous trio of questions by warning against procrastination in spiritual matters. Stop waiting for the 'perfect time'; the only moment you truly have to make a change is this one."
  },
  {
    id: 24,
    hebrew: "לֹא עָלֶיךָ הַמְּלָאכָה לִגְמֹר, וְלֹא אַתָּה בֶן חוֹרִין לִבָּטֵל מִמֶּנָּה",

    source: "Pirkei Avot 2:16",

    translation: "According to the effort is the reward.",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 5:23",

    hebrew: "וּבָחַרְתָּ֙ בַּחַיִּ֔ים",
    translation: "Therefore, choose life.",
    source: "Deuteronomy 30:19",
    reflection: "In his final address, Moses frames free will as a binary choice between life/good and death/evil. Every day we are faced with choices that lead toward vitality and meaning or toward negativity; actively choose the path that brings life."

    translation: "Say little and do much.",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 1:15",

    translation: "Justice, justice shall you pursue.",
    source: "Deuteronomy 16:20",

    hebrew: "עֵ֥ת לִבְכּ֖וֹת וְעֵ֣ת לִשְׂח֑וֹק",
    translation: "A time to weep and a time to laugh.",
    source: "Ecclesiastes 3:4",
    reflection: "King Solomon acknowledges that the human experience requires a full range of emotions. Life is a cycle; it is healthy to embrace sadness when it comes, just as it is vital to embrace joy. Wisdom is knowing which season you are in."

    source: "Psalm 23:4",

    translation: "Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.",
    source: "Isaiah 40:31",

    hebrew: "קָר֣וֹב יְ֭הוָה לְנִשְׁבְּרֵי־לֵ֑ב",
    translation: "The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.",
    source: "Psalm 34:19",

    translation: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart.",

    translation: "The beginning of wisdom is awe of the Lord.",
    source: "Psalm 111:10",

    translation: "Either friendship or death.",
    source: "Taanit 23a",

    translation: "A fence for wisdom is silence.",
    source: "Pirkei Avot 3:13",
