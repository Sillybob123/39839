"Exodus 10:21" - "keyword": "Darkness which may be felt" - "definition": "The ninth plague was not a mere absence of light. The Torah describes it as a tangible, palpable darkness. The Midrash explains it was a thick, heavy gloom that was physically oppressive, preventing movement and isolating each person in a terrifying sensory deprivation. This supernatural quality made it profoundly psychological, a darkness that was not just seen, but experienced."
"Exodus 10:22" - "source": "Rashi" - "explanation": "Citing the Midrash, Rashi explains that the plague of darkness lasted for six days in two stages. For the first three days, the Egyptians could not see one another. For the final three days, the darkness became so thick that it was immobilizing, and they could not rise from their places. This served a dual purpose: it allowed the Israelites to prepare for their departure unobserved, and it allowed for the quiet demise of those 'wicked Israelites' who did not wish to be redeemed."
"Exodus 10:23" - "keyword": "Plague of Darkness (Choshekh)" - "definition": "This plague was a direct, theological assault on the chief deity of the Egyptian pantheon, Ra, the sun god.

"Exodus 10:24" - "source": "Ibn Ezra" - "explanation": "Pharaoh offers his final, desperate compromise: the people, including children, may go, but the livestock must remain. Ibn Ezra analyzes this as a shrewd economic tactic. By holding their flocks and herds—their primary economic assets and means of survival in the desert—hostage, Pharaoh ensures that the Israelites cannot get far and will be forced to return. It is his last attempt to maintain leverage."
"Exodus 10:26" - "source": "Sforno" - "explanation": "Moses's reply, 'not a hoof shall be left behind,' is a declaration of total liberation. Sforno explains that this is no longer a negotiation. Moses is stating the terms of their departure as a complete, economically independent nation. He cleverly adds that they do not yet know which animals God will require for sacrifice, so they must take all of them. This brilliant argument leaves no room for further bargaining."
"Exodus 10:29" - "source": "Rashi" - "explanation": "When Pharaoh banishes Moses under penalty of death, Moses replies, 'Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.' Rashi points out that Moses is not merely submitting to Pharaoh's decree. He is speaking with prophetic authority, as God had already revealed to him that this would be their final meeting. Moses's calm agreement is an assertion of his own power; he is not being dismissed, but is announcing the end of the dialogue on his own terms, with full knowledge of the final, terrible plague that is to come."
