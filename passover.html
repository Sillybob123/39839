                Passover (<em>Pesach</em>) tells the story of the Exodus from Egypt: a journey from oppression to dignity, from fear to trust, and from spiritual constriction to open possibility. Every generation is invited to experience that freedom personally.

                <h2>The Story of Passover in Brief</h2>
                <p>
                    The Israelites became enslaved in Egypt under Pharaoh. Their labor was harsh, and their future seemed sealed. G-d then chose Moses to lead them out, sending signs and plagues that revealed Divine justice and power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the final night, Jewish families marked their doors and prepared to leave quickly. They baked unleavened bread, <em>matzah</em>, because there was no time for dough to rise. At dawn, freedom began.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Exodus is not only history. It is a spiritual template: we each leave our own "Egypt" whenever we break free from habits, fears, and limitations that keep us from serving G-d with clarity and joy.
                </p>
                <div class="holiday-highlight">
                    The Hebrew name "Mitzrayim" (Egypt) can also suggest "narrow places." Passover is the work of expanding the soul.

                <h3>Passover Essentials</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove chametz (leaven) from the home.</li>
                    <li>Eat matzah and avoid chametz during the holiday.</li>
                    <li>Tell the Exodus story at the Seder table.</li>
                    <li>Ask questions, sing, and involve everyone.</li>

                    Central idea: freedom is not just "freedom from" slavery, but "freedom for" purpose, mitzvot, and holiness.

                <h2>The Seder: A Night of Memory and Awakening</h2>
                <p>
                    The Seder is designed as an experience, not just a reading. We drink four cups, eat symbolic foods, retell the story, and move from brokenness to praise. The order guides us to feel that we personally went out of Egypt.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Matzah:</strong> humility, simplicity, and faith.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maror (bitter herbs):</strong> the bitterness of slavery and suffering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Charoset:</strong> a reminder of mortar and labor, sweetened by hope.</li>
                    <li><strong>Four cups of wine:</strong> four expressions of redemption.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A powerful Seder includes explanation, warmth, singing, and thoughtful conversation. Children asking "Why is this night different?" is not a side detail; it is the heart of transmission.

                <h2>Preparing with Intention</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>One to two weeks before:</strong> begin home preparation gradually and review Seder plans.</li>
                    <li><strong>Days before:</strong> gather matzah, wine/grape juice, Haggadot, and Seder plate items.</li>
                    <li><strong>Erev Pesach:</strong> finish final chametz removal and shift into holiday calm.</li>
                    <li><strong>During Pesach:</strong> slow down, tell the story, and choose one personal growth area as your own Exodus.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Passover preparation can feel intense, but approached with purpose it becomes deeply meaningful: clearing physical space to open spiritual space.

                <h2>A Reflection for Your Table</h2>
                <p>
                    Ask: <strong>What is one "narrow place" I am ready to leave this year?</strong> Name it. Pray over it. Share it with someone you trust. Let your Seder become not only a memory of ancient redemption, but the beginning of your next chapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    May your Passover be filled with clarity, courage, and joy, and may your home be blessed with meaningful conversation, song, and deep gratitude.
