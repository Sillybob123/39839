              "explanation": "Why does the Torah, the guide for Jewish life, commence not with laws, but with the grand narrative of Creation? Rashi, citing Rabbi Isaac, explains this seemingly indirect beginning holds a profound purpose: establishing God's unequivocal Sovereignty. By detailing the act of creation, the Torah declares God as the universe's sole Creator and, therefore, its absolute Owner. This foundational truth serves as the ultimate title deed. When God later grants the Land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, no nation can legitimately accuse them of theft or conquest without right. God, the Owner, allocates His property according to His divine plan. This opening teaches a fundamental Jewish value: recognizing God's ultimate authority over existence, and understanding that Israel's connection to its ancestral land is rooted in a divine promise, transcending purely political or military claims. It sets the stage for a history guided by God's hand."

Rashi, drawing on Midrash, notes the Hebrew prefix 'Be-' can mean 'With' or 'For the sake of,' and 'Reshit' denotes 'beginning,' 'first,' or 'choicest.' Tradition identifies Torah (Divine Wisdom) and Israel (the community dedicated to living that wisdom) as primary purposes, both referred to elsewhere as 'Reshit.' Thus, 'Bereshit' implies the universe was created 'with' Wisdom as its tool, and 'for the sake' of Torah and Israel. Creation is not accidental; it has an inherent spiritual purpose: the revelation and fulfillment of Divine wisdom through the life of a dedicated people. This imbues the cosmos with meaning from its very first syllable."

Its prominent use in the initial creation account suggests a world founded on principles of natural law, order, and accountability. However, as Rashi points out (citing Midrash on Gen 2:4), God perceived that a world based solely on strict Justice could not endure human frailty. Therefore, He later integrated the Name YHVH, representing Divine Mercy (Midat HaRachamim). The initial use of 'Elohim' establishes the fundamental order and structure of reality, while anticipating the need for compassion to sustain it. It reflects the awe-inspiring power that brought existence into being."

He interprets it not as mere emptiness, but as the primordial, formless substance – akin to the Greek concept of hyle – possessing all latent potential but lacking any defined structure or actuality. God's creative act, in this interpretation, was to shape and imbue this potential with form, order, and distinct existence. This perspective highlights God's role as the Divine Organizer, bringing intelligibility and purpose out of an undifferentiated, chaotic potential. It emphasizes creation as a process of defining, separating, and ordering the fundamental 'stuff' of the universe."

The separation between light and darkness thus represents not only the physical cycle of day and night but also the moral distinction between good and evil, with the ultimate reward of spiritual illumination reserved for the righteous."

Rashi explains this precise language highlights God's absolute Oneness and solitude during the initial stage of creation. According to tradition, the angels were created on the second day (or later). Thus, on 'Day One,' God alone existed as the singular Creator, bringing forth time and existence. This subtly reinforces the core tenet of monotheism – the indivisible Unity of God – from the Bible's opening narrative."

Rashi relays the famous Midrash explaining this apparent contradiction: Originally, the sun and moon were created equal in size and intensity. However, the moon complained, arguing, 'Two kings cannot share one crown.' As a consequence for its hubris, God diminished the moon, making it the 'lesser light.' To appease the diminished moon, God gave it the stars as its host and ordained that Israel would calculate its calendar according to the lunar cycle. This narrative teaches about humility and the consequences of challenging divine order, while also explaining the moon's relative size and its importance in the Jewish calendar."

This divine act serves as an eternal lesson for human leaders: the importance of seeking counsel and involving others, even when one holds ultimate authority. Furthermore, this preempts any claim by angels of partnership in creating humanity and refutes potential arguments by heretics for multiple creator gods. The singular verb in the following verse ('And God created...') confirms God's sole agency, while the plural consultation highlights divine humility and wisdom."

Classical commentators like Maimonides clarify that the 'image' refers to our higher intellectual faculties: reason, consciousness, language, creativity, and, crucially, moral free will – the capacity to choose between good and evil. These attributes dimly reflect the Divine. Being created in God's image means every human life has infinite value and potential. It carries the profound responsibility to emulate God's attributes – to act with justice, compassion, wisdom, and creativity, thereby becoming partners with God in perfecting the world."

This grammatical structure underscores the theological point made earlier: God consulted His angelic court out of humility, but the act of creation remained His alone, affirming His sole power. Rashi also introduces a profound Midrashic interpretation of 'male and female He created them': the initial human being was created as a single, androgynous entity, containing both male and female aspects. The later separation into Adam and Eve (described in Chapter 2) emerged from this original unified being, suggesting an intrinsic complementarity and shared essence between man and woman."

The Midrash probes the depth of 'very': it includes even the Yetzer HaRa (the Inclination toward Evil). This startling idea suggests that human drives and desires, though potentially leading to sin, are also essential for positive creation – ambition fuels building, desire leads to marriage and family, etc. The challenge lies in channeling these powerful forces for good. Another profound Midrash equates 'very good' with death. From an eternal perspective, physical death is not the ultimate evil but a necessary transition enabling the soul's journey and potential reward in the World to Come, making the entire cycle of life and death part of God's perfect, 'very good' plan."

This emphasizes the absolute and immediate cessation of creative labor ('Melacha') that defines the beginning of Shabbat.

It is a day inherently blessed for spiritual pursuits and inner peace. 2) Sanctification (Kedushah): God designated it as holy by prohibiting 'Melacha' (creative labor analogous to the acts of Creation).

Therefore, God blended Justice with Mercy (YHVH) from the very inception of the account of human activity.

In the generation of Enosh, people began to profane God's name by applying it erroneously to created beings – humans, celestial bodies, or idols – attributing divine power to them. This marked the origin of idolatry, a tragic deviation from true worship."

Therefore, God 'took him' prematurely, before his allotted lifespan, as an act of grace to ensure he died while still in a state of righteousness, preventing a potential spiritual decline later in life. This contrasts with Noah, whose righteousness endured despite his generation."

We learn that existence is neither random nor indifferent; a loving God speaks the world into being and entrusts it to human guardians created b'tzelem Elohim, in His image. The stories of Eden, Cain and Abel, and the generations that follow show both the wonder of free will and the havoc it can wreak when untethered from moral purpose. Yet every failure is met with the possibility of return. From the very first verse we are called to build lives that echo God's goodness, treating each person and every choice as part of a divine story that has meaning and direction."

God resolves to bring a great flood, saving only the righteous Noah, his family, and animals in an ark. After the flood, God establishes a new covenant with humanity, symbolized by the rainbow. The parsha ends with the story of the Tower of Babel, where humanity's unified defiance leads to their languages being confused and their being scattered across the earth.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: This is a story of destruction and rebirth. It teaches that while humanity has the capacity for self-destruction, God always provides a path for renewal. The main lesson is about the responsibility of a righteous individual in a corrupt society. Noah's righteousness saves the world. The Tower of Babel then serves as a powerful counter-lesson: unity without a moral, divine purpose is arrogance and leads to breakdown, not greatness. Noach is the saga of a world gone dark—and of the lone light that keeps hope alive. Violence and corruption nearly erase creation, but one righteous individual has the courage to stand apart and becomes the seed of renewal. After the waters recede, the rainbow covenant reaffirms that God will not abandon humanity, even when we stumble. God always leaves a path back, but He waits for us to choose righteousness and humility."

      "significance": "Parsha Summary: The Torah's focus shifts from all humanity to one family. God commands Abram (later Abraham) \"Lech Lecha\"—\"Go forth from your land\"—to a new, unknown land. God promises to make him a great nation. This parsha details his journey, his separation from his nephew Lot, the Covenant Between the Parts (where God promises the land to his descendants), and the establishment of Brit Milah (circumcision) as the physical sign of this eternal covenant.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: This is the birth of the Jewish people. The central theme is faith. Abraham is the ultimate model of emunah (faith), leaving everything familiar to follow a divine call. The phrase \"Lech Lecha\" can be translated as \"Go for yourself,\" teaching a beautiful lesson: it is precisely by leaving our comfort zone for a higher purpose that we discover who we are truly meant to be. Lech-Lecha chronicles the moment a single family steps into the unknown and history changes course. Abram hears the words \"Go for yourself\"—leave comfort, leave certainty—and discovers that true identity is born in the journey toward a higher calling. Covenants of land, nationhood, and brit milah translate faith into life in the body and on the soil. Living a life of emunah means trusting that God's call, though demanding, reveals our truest self. By saying yes to that call we become channels of blessing for the whole world."

She sinned with salt by being miserly and inhospitable when the angelic guests arrived, allegedly complaining about having to provide them with salt. Thus, she was punished through salt. 2) Alternatively, she looked back out of lingering attachment to her sinful home or, more charitably, out of compassion and concern for her married daughters who remained behind in Sodom. Either way, her looking back signified a failure to fully detach from the condemned place."

Abraham then famously argues with God to save the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot is saved, the cities are destroyed, and Isaac is finally born. The parsha culminates in the Akedah, the Binding of Isaac, where Abraham is tested with the command to sacrifice his beloved son.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: Vayera paints Abraham as a man whose tent is open to strangers and whose heart is bold enough to argue with Heaven. Hospitality, advocacy for Sodom, the birth of Isaac, and the Akedah weave together kindness, justice, and awe-filled obedience. The Binding forces us to wrestle with the tension between divine command and human ethics—and teaches that God desires loyalty that never abandons conscience. Holiness is expressed both in generosity to people and in unwavering devotion to God; the greatest heroes hold both simultaneously."

Abraham negotiates with the Hittites to purchase the Cave of Machpelah as a family burial plot, establishing the first permanent, legal Israelite holding in the land of Canaan. The majority of the parsha is then dedicated to Abraham's servant, Eliezer, on his mission to find a wife (Rebekah) for Isaac, a story filled with prayer, signs, and acts of kindness.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: Chayei Sara is a meditation on continuity. Abraham arranges Sarah's burial in Machpelah, securing an eternal foothold in the promised land, and dispatches Eliezer to find a spouse who will carry the covenant forward with Isaac. Rebekah's kindness at the well shows that destiny rests on everyday acts of compassion. Dreams survive only when we invest in the future—preserving our stories, anchoring ourselves to sacred space, and ensuring the next generation is ready to inherit both land and mission."

      "significance": "Parsha Summary: \"Toldot\" (Generations) tells the story of Isaac and Rebekah's twin sons, Jacob and Esau. The brothers are opposites: Esau the physical \"man of the field,\" and Jacob the spiritual \"dweller in tents\". Jacob famously acquires Esau's birthright (bechorah) for a bowl of stew. Later, with Rebekah's encouragement, Jacob deceives his blind father Isaac to \"steal\" the blessing intended for Esau, forcing him to flee for his life.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: Toldot reveals a family wrestling with inheritance—who will carry Abraham's spiritual torch? Jacob hungers for the birthright while Esau squanders it, yet the path to blessing winds through painful deception and exile. The parsha reminds us that sacred legacies aren't inherited automatically; they must be chosen, valued, and sometimes fought for. Becoming \"Israel\" demands integrity and courage. We must decide what kind of people we wish to be and live up to the destiny we claim."

The night before, he wrestles with a mysterious man (an angel) and is given a new name: Yisrael (Israel), meaning \"one who struggles with God.\" He then has a tense but peaceful reunion with Esau. The parsha concludes with the tragic story of Dinah's assault and the violent, vengeful response of her brothers, Simeon and Levi.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: Vayishlach captures Jacob's transformation. He wrestles through the night, confronts Esau, faces the family trauma of Dinah, and receives a new name—Yisrael, one who struggles with God. Not every battle ends in victory, but the struggle itself shapes him into someone capable of meeting the future honestly. We are defined less by the wounds we suffer than by the courage with which we face them. Justice must be pursued with wisdom, and reconciliation sought without surrendering principle."

      "significance": "Parsha Summary: \"And he settled.\" This parsha begins the famous Joseph story. Jacob favors his son Joseph, giving him an ornamented coat, which fuels intense jealousy from his brothers. Joseph's arrogant dreams of superiority are the final straw. The brothers plot to kill him, but Judah intervenes, and they instead sell him into slavery. The story then cuts to the narrative of Judah and Tamar, before returning to Joseph in Egypt, where he resists the advances of Potiphar's wife and is unjustly thrown into prison.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: Vayeshev turns the camera toward Joseph—a gifted young man whose dreams ignite jealousy and whose integrity is tested in darkness. Betrayed by brothers, sold into slavery, imprisoned despite innocence, he clings to the conviction that God is still with him. The interlude of Judah and Tamar shows that growth can sprout from failure. Even when life feels like a pit, faithfulness to God and moral courage can transform descent into the first step of redemption."

According to tradition, she was conceived just before the family left Canaan and born immediately upon their arrival within the walls of Egypt. Her inclusion brings the count to the significant number seventy, representing the complete family unit. An alternative view suggests God Himself counted as the seventieth, accompanying them into exile."

Joseph reveals his identity and reframes their betrayal as part of God's plan to save lives. The family relocates to Goshen, united at last. Teshuvah is real.

Jacob blesses his sons and grandsons, maps the future of the tribes, and insists on burial in the land to declare that Egypt is a station, not a destiny. Joseph reiterates the promise that God will redeem his people and makes them swear to carry his bones home. Faith looks beyond the present moment. We bless the next generation, hold fast to hope, and trust that God will remember His people and lead them forward."

Generations pass, and a new Pharaoh arises who \"did not know Joseph.\" Fearing the Israelites' growing numbers, he enslaves them and decrees that all newborn Hebrew boys be thrown into the Nile. In the midst of this oppression, Moses is born, saved by Pharaoh's daughter, and grows up in the royal palace. He kills an Egyptian taskmaster and flees to Midian. There, God appears to a reluctant Moses at the Burning Bush, revealing His name and commanding him to return to Egypt to liberate his people. Moses's initial confrontation with Pharaoh only results in the Israelites' burdens being made even heavier.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: This parsha pivots the Torah from the story of a single family (Genesis) to the epic of an entire nation. The central lesson is about leadership and empathy. Moses, raised as a prince, \"went out to his kinsfolk and witnessed their labors\" (Exodus 2:11). His ability to see and feel their pain is what makes him worthy of being their leader. The parsha also begins with the courageous civil disobedience of the midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, who \"feared God\" more than Pharaoh. Their actions teach a powerful, eternal lesson: morality and conscience must always take precedence over the unjust laws of any human ruler."

God reveals Himself using the four expressions of redemption (\"I will bring you out... I will deliver you... I will redeem you... I will take you\"). Moses and Aaron then begin the divine assault on the Egyptian empire, unleashing the first seven of the Ten Plagues: Blood (Dam), Frogs (Tzefardea), Lice (Kinim), Wild Beasts (Arov), Pestilence (Dever), Boils (Shechin), and Hail (Barad). With each plague, Pharaoh's \"heart is hardened,\" and he refuses to let the people go.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: This parsha is a systematic dismantling of the Egyptian worldview. Each plague is not just a random disaster but a direct, theological attack on a specific Egyptian deity—the god of the Nile, the frog-god, the sun-god Ra. The plagues are a lesson in divine power, showing that the gods of Egypt are powerless before the one true God. The parsha's main takeaway is about the nature of free will and stubbornness. Pharaoh's \"hardened heart\" (kaved lev) teaches that if a person repeatedly refuses to acknowledge the truth, they can reach a point where they lose the very ability to choose good. Stubbornness becomes its own prison."

This parsha delivers the last three plagues: a supernatural plague of Locusts (Arbeh), a palpable Darkness (Choshech) that \"people could not see one another\" while the Israelites \"had light in their dwellings,\" and the devastating climactic plague, the Death of the Firstborn (Makat Bechorot). Before this final plague, God commands the Israelites to perform the first Passover (Pesach) sacrifice, painting the blood on their doorposts as a sign of faith. This plague finally breaks Pharaoh, who begs the Israelites to leave.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: This parsha marks the physical act of liberation. The key lesson is one of collective identity and active faith. The Passover sacrifice is the first ritual that the Israelites must perform as a nation. They are no longer passive victims; they must actively choose to be part of the covenant by participating in the ritual. The contrast between darkness and light is a beautiful lesson: even in a world consumed by an \"oppressive darkness,\" it is possible for a community to create and maintain its own spiritual light."

      "significance": "Parsha Summary: \"When he sent.\" Pharaoh allows the people to leave, but God leads them on an indirect path. Pharaoh pursues them, trapping them at the Red Sea (Yam Suf). As the people cry out in terror, Moses lifts his staff and God splits the sea, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry land. The Egyptian army is drowned when they follow. The people, led by Moses and Miriam, break out into the \"Song of the Sea\" (Shirat HaYam). This spiritual high is short-lived; the people immediately begin to grumble about the lack of water and food. God provides them with Manna from heaven and fresh water from a rock. The parsha ends with the unprovoked, symbolic attack by the tribe of Amalek.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: This parsha teaches that physical redemption is only the first step. The Israelites are free from Egypt, but they have not yet freed \"Egypt\" from themselves—they still have the mentality of slaves, complaining at the first sign of trouble. The central lesson is that faith is not a one-time event; it is a daily struggle. We must constantly choose belief over despair, gratitude over complaint. The Manna, which came \"a day's portion each day,\" teaches us to trust God for our daily bread and not be consumed by anxiety for the future."

      "significance": "Parsha Summary: Moses's father-in-law, Jethro (Yitro), hears of the miracles and rejoins Moses in the desert. He sees Moses judging the people from morning till night and gives him crucial advice: to delegate authority by appointing a hierarchy of judges. Moses accepts this wisdom. The Israelites then arrive at Mount Sinai, where they prepare for three days. God descends upon the mountain in \"thunder and lightning, and a dense cloud,\" and in a moment of awesome national revelation, the entire people hear God speak the Ten Commandments (Aseret HaDibrot).\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: This is the spiritual climax of the Torah. If the Exodus was liberation from slavery, Sinai is liberation to a purpose. The people are transformed from a tribe of runaway slaves into a holy nation bound by a covenant. The parsha offers two profound lessons. First, from Jethro, an \"outsider,\" we learn that wisdom can come from anyone and that great leadership is not about doing everything yourself, but about empowering others. Second, the revelation at Sinai, witnessed by every man, woman, and child, establishes that Jewish faith is not based on a private miracle, but on a shared, public experience."

      "significance": "Parsha Summary: \"Ordinances.\" Immediately following the spiritual revelation of the Ten Commandments, this parsha gives a dense list of mishpatim—social and civil laws. These laws govern the details of everyday life: laws for servants, personal injury (\"an eye for an eye\"), property damage, theft, and interest-free loans. Most importantly, it gives repeated, specific commands to protect the most vulnerable members of society: the widow, the orphan, and the stranger (ger). The parsha concludes with the people formally accepting the covenant, declaring, Na'aseh v'Nishma (\"All that God has spoken, we will do and we will hear\").\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: This parsha is the essential grounding of the Torah. It teaches that spirituality is not an abstract concept; it is expressed in how we build a just and compassionate society. The central lesson is that a holy nation is defined by its social justice. The repeated command to love the stranger—\"for you know the feelings of the stranger, having yourselves been strangers in the land of Egypt\" (Exodus 23:9)—is the heart of the mishpatim. It commands us to transform our national memory of suffering not into a desire for power, but into a radical empathy for all who are on the outside."

      "significance": "Parsha Summary: \"An offering.\" After the legal code of Mishpatim, God asks Moses to collect a voluntary \"offering\" from the people to build a Mishkan (a portable Tabernacle). The parsha provides the exact, intricate blueprints for this sanctuary. It details the construction of the Ark of the Covenant (Aron Habrit) to hold the tablets, the golden Table (Shulchan) for the showbread, and the seven-branched golden Menorah. God's purpose for this building is stated clearly: \"And they shall make Me a sanctuary, and I will dwell among them\" (v'shachanti b'tocham).\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: The Mishkan is the solution to the problem of how to maintain a connection with God after the peak experience of Sinai. The beautiful lesson is found in God's specific wording. God asks for a gift from \"every person whose heart is so moved,\" teaching that holiness can only be built from generosity, not coercion. Most profoundly, God does not say \"I will dwell in it\" (the building) but \"I will dwell in them\" (the people). This teaches that the entire purpose of building the physical sanctuary was to create a shared project that would, in turn, build a spiritual sanctuary inside the heart of each person and the community."

      "significance": "Parsha Summary: \"You shall command.\" This parsha focuses on the Kohanim (priests) who will serve in the Mishkan. It begins with the command to bring pure olive oil for the Ner Tamid, the \"eternal light\" of the Menorah. It then describes in detail the sacred, symbolic garments for Aaron (the High Priest) and his sons, including the Choshen (breastplate) with its 12 stones representing the tribes, and the golden frontlet (Tzitz) inscribed with \"Holy to God.\" The parsha concludes with instructions for the golden incense altar, which stood inside the holy place.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: This parsha teaches about the awesome responsibility of representing the community before God. The High Priest does not act as an individual; he is a living symbol of the entire nation. He carries the names of the 12 tribes on his shoulders (on the Ephod straps) and over his heart (on the Choshen). This is a powerful, eternal lesson for any leader: true leadership means literally carrying the burden of your people on your shoulders and holding their well-being and concerns in your heart."

      "significance": "Parsha Summary: \"When you count.\" This parsha contains the greatest crisis in the wilderness. It begins with the laws of the census (a half-shekel donation), the anointing oil, and the incense. While Moses is on Mount Sinai for 40 days, the people grow fearful and force Aaron to build a Golden Calf (Egel HaZahav). God is enraged and threatens to destroy the nation, but Moses intercedes, pleading for mercy. Moses descends with the first set of tablets, sees the people dancing around the idol, and in a moment of righteous fury, shatters them. After punishing the instigators, Moses re-ascends the mountain to beg for forgiveness, and God reveals His Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. Moses returns with a second, replacement set of tablets.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: The core theme is the fragility of faith and the power of forgiveness. The shattering of the first tablets represents a broken covenant. The parsha's lesson, however, is that no failure is final. The fact that God gives a second set of tablets is the ultimate symbol of teshuvah (repentance). It teaches that our relationship with God is not so brittle that it can be permanently destroyed by one sin. Through Moses's intercession, we learn that God's essence is not unbending justice but infinite compassion, and that a broken relationship can be rebuilt."

      "significance": "Parsha Summary: \"And he assembled.\" After the trauma of the Golden Calf, Moses assembles the people. His first act is to reiterate the commandment of Shabbat, teaching that even the urgent work of building the Mishkan cannot override it. He then calls for the voluntary donations for the Mishkan (as in Terumah). This time, the people respond with overwhelming generosity, bringing \"more than enough.\" The rest of the parsha describes the actual construction of the Mishkan and its vessels by the inspired artisans Bezalel and Oholiab, carefully following the blueprints from earlier parshas.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: This parsha is the great \"repair\" (tikkun) for the sin of the Golden Calf. The sin began when the people \"assembled\" (vayikahel) against Aaron to build an idol. Now, Moses reclaims that same act of \"assembling\" for a holy purpose. The main lesson is that the antidote to sin is not just sorrow, but positive action. The people channel their misguided energy and excess wealth (the same gold from the calf) into a unified, sacred project. By repeating the law of Shabbat first, Moses teaches a profound lesson: how we build is as important as what we build. Holy ends cannot be achieved through unholy means."

It meticulously lists and \"accounts for\" all the precious materials donated by the people, showing that everything was used for its intended sacred purpose. The priestly garments are completed, and all the components are brought to Moses. On the first day of the first month, Moses follows God's instructions and erects the Tabernacle, anoints its vessels, and consecrates Aaron and his sons. As soon as the work is finished, the Divine \"Cloud of Glory\" covers the tent and the \"Presence of God filled the Tabernacle,\" signifying that God had accepted their work.\n\nSignificance & Takeaway: This is the grand finale of the Book of Exodus. The book that began with \"Names\" (Shemot) and a people in slavery, ends with \"Accountings\" (Pekudei) and the presence of God dwelling among them. The lesson is one of partnership and completion. The Israelites, who failed so spectacularly with the Golden Calf, have now successfully completed a holy task. The parsha concludes with a beautiful image: \"Moses could not enter the Tent... because the Presence of God filled the Tabernacle.\" Moses, the great leader, has now fulfilled his purpose. He has built the structure that allows the people to have a direct relationship with God, and he now steps aside so that God's glory can be the center."
